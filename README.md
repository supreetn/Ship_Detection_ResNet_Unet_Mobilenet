Airbus satellite ship detection Kaggle challenge using Deep Learning models. 
Hereâ€™s the backstory: Shipping traffic is growing fast. More ships increase the chances of infractions at sea like environmentally devastating ship accidents, piracy, illegal fishing, drug trafficking, and illegal cargo movement. This has compelled many organizations, from environmental protection agencies to insurance companies and national government authorities, to have a closer watch over the open seas.

Airbus offers comprehensive maritime monitoring services by building a meaningful solution for wide coverage, fine details, intensive monitoring, premium reactivity and interpretation response. Combining its proprietary-data with highly-trained analysts, they help to support the maritime industry to increase knowledge, anticipate threats, trigger alerts, and improve efficiency at sea.

**Evaluation**
This competition is evaluated on the F2 Score at different intersection over union (IoU) thresholds. The metric sweeps over a range of IoU thresholds, at each point calculating an F2 Score. The threshold values range from 0.5 to 0.95 with a step size of 0.05: (0.5, 0.55, 0.6, 0.65, 0.7, 0.75, 0.8, 0.85, 0.9, 0.95). In other words, at a threshold of 0.5, a predicted object is considered a "hit" if its intersection over union with a ground truth object is greater than 0.5.

At each threshold value , the F2 Score value is calculated based on the number of true positives (TP), false negatives (FN), and false positives (FP) resulting from comparing the predicted object to all ground truth objects. A true positive is counted when a single predicted object matches a ground truth object with an IoU above the threshold. A false positive indicates a predicted object had no associated ground truth object. A false negative indicates a ground truth object had no associated predicted object. The average F2 Score of a single image is then calculated as the mean of the above F2 Score values at each IoU threshold
Lastly, the score returned by the competition metric is the mean taken over the individual average F2 Scores of each image in the test dataset.
Finally the output csv has the location of pixels containing the ships in the particular image.
